# SaaS-Readiness Iteration Plan

**Owner:** @dimaszisby (single-developer)
**Cadence:** Iterative; no fixed deadline. Each phase is a self-contained PR.
**Source of truth for gap IDs:** [`audit-2026-05-01.md`](./audit-2026-05-01.md).
**Source of truth for the binary fork-ready gate:** ADR-001 in [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md).

This is the master roadmap for closing the 18 ❌ + 21 ⚠️ items in the audit. Each phase below has its own kit (or extends an existing kit) under `documents/development/architecture/`. P2-only items are deferred and not yet scaffolded.

Status legend: ⏳ Scaffolded = doc kit exists, no code yet · ⏳ Ready to kick off = no kit, single ADR is the artifact · ⏳ Blocked = kit exists but a Proposed ADR must be Accepted before code starts · ⚠️ Mostly Done = primary targets closed but one or more sub-items remain partial · ✅ Done = all phase targets closed · 🅿️ Deferred = scaffold only; do not start.

**Phase 6 partial:** P1-11.2 (CONTRIBUTING.md), P1-11.3 (`scripts/bootstrap-fork.sh`), and P1-11.4 (APP_NAME centralization) are closed. P2-11.5 (CachePort consolidation) shipped a shared `CachePort<T>` in `src/shared/application/ports/`, but only `metric-category` re-exports it; `metric`, `metric-log`, `analytics`, and `metric-settings` still declare per-feature ports. See `audit-2026-05-20.md` § P2-11.5.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **Phase 0** first (S-effort, ~1 day total). Closes 4 P0s including LICENSE + README + .env.example, immediately satisfying fork-ready exit criterion #4.
2. **Phase 1** next. Refresh tokens + verify-port leak block any cleanup of auth.
3. **Phase 2** in parallel with 1 if context allows — observability has no overlap with auth code.
4. **Phase 3** (email verification) builds on Phase 1's TokenProvider.verify() extension.
5. **Phase 6** (forkability) can interleave whenever a small slot opens — most items are S-effort.
6. **Phase 7** (production runtime) before any production traffic.
7. **Phase 4** (multi-tenancy) once ADR-004 is Accepted. Largest effort; touches every domain table.
8. **Phase 5** (drift cleanup) after multi-tenancy's table changes settle, since drift fixes will collide with `organization_id` migrations.
9. **Phase 8** (subscription) once Phase 4 lands — billing is per-organization.

## Per-Phase Kit Map

Each kit's `README.md` ends with the same cross-reference block so the audit re-runs can mechanically verify mapping:

```md
## References

- **Closes audit gaps:** [P0-X.Y], [P1-A.B] in `documents/development/architecture/saas-readiness/audit-2026-05-01.md`
- **Owning ADRs:** ADR-NNN in `documents/development/architecture/saas-readiness/decisions.md`; (kit-local) ADR-001 in `./decisions.md`
- **Effort:** S/M/L
- **Status:** Proposed | In progress | Accepted
- **Predecessor / dependency:** (e.g., "depends on Phase 1 completing the TokenProvider.verify() extension")
```

When a phase ships, the row in this file moves from ⏳ Scaffolded → ✅ Done with a link to the merged PR. The audit re-run script can then auto-mark the closed gap IDs as ✅ in the next dated audit file.

## P2-Only Items (Deferred — Not Scaffolded)

These items in `audit-2026-05-01.md` are not blocking and have no kit yet. Open one when the work is up next:

- P2-1.4 — OAuth / social login
- P2-2.2 — Shared `Page<T>` pagination helper
- P2-3.3 — Dev/test seed scripts
- P2-4.5 — CORS multi-origin
- P2-4.6 — `xss-clean` retirement
- P2-5.4 — APM / metrics readiness (Prometheus)
- P2-9.3 — General feature-flag system
- P2-9.4 — Outbound webhook delivery

## Maintenance Rules

- **Append-only:** finished phases keep their row (status → ✅ Done with PR link). Do not delete.
- **One mutable surface:** the **Status** column of each row. Everything else describes intent and should not change.
- **Cross-link bidirectionally:** every kit's `README.md` references this file in its "Predecessor / dependency" line; this file references every kit folder.
- **Rerun audit after each phase:** generate a new dated `audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`; diff its scorecard against `audit-2026-05-01.md` so the closed gaps are visible in the public `SAAS-BASE-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Audit History

- `audit-2026-05-01.md` — original baseline: 26 ✅ / 21 ⚠️ / 18 ❌; 7 P0, 17 P1, 11 P2 open; NOT fork-ready (3 of 4 ADR-001 criteria fail).
- `audit-2026-05-20.md` — post Phases 0–7: 52 ✅ / 9 ⚠️ / 4 ❌; 0 P0, 4 P1, 9 P2 open; criterion #3 still fails on Cat 4 (62.5%, blocked by P1-4.2 env-reads). Functionally shippable; not strictly fork-ready under ADR-001.
- `audit-2026-05-24-independent.md` — independent re-audit: **GOLD WITH CAVEATS**; ADR-001 gate PASS; 6 caveats + 8 judgment items. Source code unchanged through 2026-06-05.
- `audit-2026-06-05.md` — fresh threat-surface re-audit: **GOLD WITH CAVEATS — DOWNGRADED PENDING N1+N2+F1**. C1–C6 open-unchanged. Two new P0 (cache-layer cross-tenant scoping) + one new HIGH (DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING no prod guard). Six P1 + six P2 + four P3 newly surfaced. ADR-003 reopened (see ADR-011).

**Recommended execution order for the 2026-06-05 batch:**

1. **Same-day patch PR** — N1 + N2 + F1 (cumulative ≤2h). Cross-tenant cache disclosure + rate-limit killswitch are the two findings that meaningfully shift the verdict.
2. **Within-week** — N3, N4, N5, F2, F3, F4 + close C5/C6 from the 05-24 punch list (all are ≤1d).
3. **Within-month** — C1/C3/C4 closure (the long-tracked caveats), N7/N8/N9 scaling defaults, ADR-011 persistence-layout migration.
4. **Defer-and-track** — N6 per-org queue routing (becomes urgent when a fair-use SLA is signed); Phase 8 subscription/billing remains the only deferred initiative.
