# Shared Middleware Modules
- Timestamp: 2025-12-03T21:45:00Z

## Purpose
As part of the Phase 4 vertical slice migration we retired the legacy `src/middleware` folder. All cross-cutting middleware now lives alongside the features (auth) or inside `src/shared/middleware`. This document captures the new conventions so future slices follow the same pattern.

## Modules
| Concern | Module | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Auth guard | `src/features/auth/infrastructure/http/authMiddleware.ts` | Depends on the auth feature’s repository/use cases and converts the user to the domain model. |
| Rate limiting | `src/shared/middleware/rate-limiter.ts` | Provides `globalRateLimiter`, `userRateLimiter`, and `analyticsRateLimiter` plus corresponding factory helpers. |
| Request validation | `src/shared/middleware/validation.ts` | Exposes the `validate` middleware supporting both full-schema and bag mode; attaches `req.validated`. |
| Cache responses | `src/shared/middleware/cache.ts` | Wraps Redis caching logic and logs cache hits/misses. |
| Role guard | `src/shared/middleware/role.ts` | Provides `createRoleMiddleware` factory for RBAC checks. |
| pickValidated helper | `src/shared/middleware/validated.ts` | Supplies the `pickValidated` helper used by controllers. |
| Error handler | `src/shared/middleware/error.ts` | Centralized error handler that hides stack traces in production. |

Each module exports both a default instance (e.g., `authMiddleware`, `globalRateLimiter`) and factory helpers (`createAuthMiddleware`, `createGlobalRateLimiter`, etc.) so tests/composition roots can override dependencies.

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Import directly from the feature/shared module.** Avoid introducing new wrappers under `src/middleware`.
2. **Prefer factories in tests.** When a test needs to override dependencies (e.g., swap the Redis client or user repo), use the exported `create*` helper.
3. **Document new middleware.** If you add additional shared middleware, update this document and the Phase 4 checklist so future engineers know where to look.
4. **Server wiring.** `src/server.ts` imports middleware from the modules above; additional server-level wiring should follow the same pattern.

## Migration Notes
- Legacy files under `src/middleware` have been deleted; path aliases referencing that folder were removed from `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json`.
- Historical documentation pointing to `src/middleware/*` has been updated to reference the modules listed here.

## Cursor Cache Key Convention
- Timestamp: 2025-12-14T17:40:00+07:00

All cursor/list caches across feature slices must use the shared helper at `src/shared/cache/keys.ts`.

- `buildCursorCacheKey({ feature, version, userId, segments })` generates keys in the format `cursor:<feature>:v<version>:<user>:<k1>:<v1>:...`. Missing values collapse to `_`, booleans serialize to `1/0`, and numeric input stays numeric.
- `cursorCacheNamespace(feature, versionOrWildcard)` returns the namespace prefix so invalidation logic can call `delByPattern` with strings such as ``${cursorCacheNamespace("metric-logs", "*")}:${userId}:*``.
- Feature slices own their feature slug + version (e.g., metrics = `feature: "metrics", version: 1`; metric logs = `feature: "metric-logs", version: 2`). Bumping versions should happen alongside cache invalidation updates.
- Metric, metric-log, metric-settings, and metric-category routers/use cases now adhere to this convention; future cursor endpoints must do the same.

## Cache Invalidation Logging

- Use `logCacheInvalidation(scope, context)` from `src/shared/cache/logging.ts` whenever a cache invalidation completes successfully. The helper emits a single `[CACHE] invalidate` debug log with the provided metadata.
- Use `logCacheInvalidationError(scope, error, context)` inside `catch` blocks to capture failures with the same scope/context payload; the helper logs via `logger.error`.
- Avoid slice-specific `logger.info` statements for cache invalidations—stick to the shared helper so log levels and payloads remain consistent across slices.
