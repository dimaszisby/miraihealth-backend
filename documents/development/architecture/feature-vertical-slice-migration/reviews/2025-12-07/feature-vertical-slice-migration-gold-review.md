# Feature Vertical Slice Migration – Gold Review (Post-Implementation)

> **Objective:** Confirm that remediation tasks from `feature-vertical-slice-migration-stabilize-feature-pattern-plan.md` resolved the findings documented in `feature-vertical-slice-migration-in-depth-review.md`.

## How to Perform the Gold Review

1. Pull the latest code after stabilization tasks land on the main branch.
2. Re-run any automated tests introduced during remediation.
3. For each finding ID, inspect the relevant files/commits and capture the outcome.
4. Note any regressions or new inconsistencies as new finding IDs (e.g., `AN-NEW-01`).
5. Summarize whether the feature is “gold” (pattern-compliant) or needs another iteration.

## Feature: analytics

### Status Summary

Read/query flows now live behind `VisualizationReadRepository`, caching is abstracted via `VisualizationCachePort`, and the HTTP layer resolves dependencies through `buildAnalyticsFeature`. Controllers and tests exercise the slice without importing Sequelize or Redis helpers directly, so the feature matches the vertical-slice contract.

### Findings Status

- **AN-01 – Queries import Sequelize and raw SQL directly**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/analytics/application/queries/GetDashboardVisualization.ts:8-46` depends only on `VisualizationReadRepository`; all SQL remains inside `src/features/analytics/infrastructure/persistence/VisualizationReadRepoSequelize.ts:60-220`.
  - Notes: Unit coverage via `__tests__/features/analytics/application/GetDashboardVisualization.test.ts:1` stubs the port, confirming DI works.

- **AN-02 – Cache access bypasses a CachePort**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/analytics/application/ports/VisualizationCachePort.ts:1-36` defines cache operations; `VisualizationReadRepoSequelize` receives a `VisualizationCacheRedis` adapter (`src/features/analytics/infrastructure/cache/VisualizationCacheRedis.ts`) and no longer references legacy helpers.
  - Notes: Adapter tests in `__tests__/features/analytics/infrastructure/persistence/VisualizationReadRepoSequelize.test.ts:1` verify cache hits/misses.

- **AN-03 – No feature builder or canonical HTTP layer**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/analytics/feature.ts:1-22` wires cache + repo and exposes a feature container consumed by `src/features/analytics/infrastructure/http/controller.ts:8-64`; router now lives at `src/features/analytics/infrastructure/http/router.ts:1-24`.
  - Notes: Controllers support dependency overrides for testing through `overrideAnalyticsFeature`.

---

## Feature: auth

### Status Summary

Auth owns its DTOs, Zod schemas, and response mappers under `infrastructure/http`, and the router exclusively references feature-local validation. Transport mapping is encapsulated via `UserMapper`, so the slice is self-contained.

### Findings Status

- **AUTH-01 – Zod schemas live in global `/types` instead of the feature**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/auth/infrastructure/http/schema.zod.ts:1-35` defines register/login/update schemas, and `router.ts:1-27` imports them for each route.
  - Notes: Shared `/types` references were removed; validations now align with the canonical layout.

- **AUTH-02 – Controllers rely on shared user DTO/mappers**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/auth/infrastructure/mappers/UserMapper.ts:1-26` plus `src/features/auth/infrastructure/http/dto.ts:1-27` live inside the feature, and `controller.ts:1-40` imports `toUserResponseDTO` from that mapper.
  - Notes: Enables independent evolution of auth response payloads.

---

## Feature: metric

### Status Summary

All read flows are mediated through `MetricReadRepository`, the infrastructure adapter holds Sequelize-specific logic, and mutation use-cases rely solely on repository methods plus cache ports. Shared helpers were eliminated.

### Findings Status

- **M-01 – `ListMetrics` query depends on global models and mappers**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric/application/queries/ListMetrics.ts:1-17` accepts only `MetricReadRepository`; raw SQL lives in `src/features/metric/infrastructure/persistence/repositories/MetricReadRepoSequelize.ts:1-320`.
  - Notes: Unit tests in `__tests__/features/metric/application/ListMetrics.test.ts:1-44` stub the port, while adapter tests (`__tests__/features/metric/infrastructure/persistence/MetricReadRepoSequelize.test.ts:1-95`) exercise pagination.

- **M-02 – `GetMetricDetail` bypasses ports and performs ORM logic inline**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric/application/queries/GetMetricDetail.ts:1-34` now calls `repo.findDetailedMetric`, and the adapter handles includes/mapping (`MetricReadRepoSequelize.ts:200-320`).
  - Notes: Guard logic (isPublic check) remains in the query; behavior covered by `__tests__/features/metric/application/GetMetricDetail.test.ts:1-72`.

- **M-03 – Update logic uses shared helpers instead of repositories**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric/application/use-cases/UpdateMetric.ts:1-35` calls `MetricRepository.findOwnedById` + `repo.save`, with cache invalidation centralized.
  - Notes: Shared helpers `findOwnedMetric`/`toDomainMetric` are no longer imported anywhere in application code.

## Feature: metric-category

### Status Summary

Metric-category now exposes both read and write flows via use-cases/queries, and the dummy endpoints go through the new `GenerateDummyCategories` use-case that coordinates factory, repo, and cache adapters. Folder layout adheres to CQRS naming.

### Findings Status

- **MC-01 – Dummy endpoint bypasses the application layer**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric-category/application/use-cases/GenerateDummyCategories.ts:1-39` orchestrates factory + repo + cache, and the controller delegates to this use-case (`src/features/metric-category/infrastructure/http/controller.ts:56-112`).
  - Notes: Regression tests in `__tests__/features/metric-category/application/GenerateDummyCategories.test.ts:1-82` assert cache invalidation behavior.

- **MC-02 – Read operations live under `use-cases` instead of `queries`**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: Read flows were moved to `src/features/metric-category/application/queries/ListCategories.ts` and `GetCategory.ts`, leaving `use-cases/` with mutations only (`src/features/metric-category/application` now contains a `queries/` folder).
  - Notes: Documentation and imports were updated to reflect the new structure.

## Feature: metric-log

### Status Summary

Metric-log’s cursor listing depends on the `MetricLogQueryPort`, with the Sequelize adapter in infrastructure, and DTOs/Zod schemas are defined inside the slice’s HTTP folder. Tests cover both query behavior and adapter pagination.

### Findings Status

- **ML-01 – Cursor query ties directly to shared DTOs and ORM models**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric-log/application/queries/ListMetricLogs.ts:1-23` only interacts with `MetricLogQueryPort`; the adapter `src/features/metric-log/infrastructure/persistence/repositories/MetricLogQueryRepoSequelize.ts:1-169` encapsulates Sequelize logic.
  - Notes: Unit tests in `__tests__/features/metric-log/application/ListMetricLogs.test.ts:1-38` stub the port to verify CQRS boundaries.

- **ML-02 – HTTP layer depends on global DTO/schema modules**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: DTOs and schemas now live under `src/features/metric-log/infrastructure/http/{dto.ts,schema.zod.ts}`, and the controller imports them locally (`src/features/metric-log/infrastructure/http/controller.ts:9-30`).
  - Notes: Shared DTO exports were removed; router uses `validate` with the new schemas.

---

## Feature: metric-settings

### Status Summary

Metric-settings localizes DTOs/mappers and Zod schemas, controllers parse payloads via `schema.zod.ts`, and new schema tests guard edge cases (goal/timeframe/display validations). The slice now fully owns its transport contract.

### Findings Status

- **MS-01 – Controllers use shared DTOs/mappers**

  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric-settings/infrastructure/mappers/MetricSettingsMapper.ts` (and DTOs under `infrastructure/http/dto.ts`) are referenced by `controller.ts:1-70`, eliminating shared mapper imports.
  - Notes: Response DTOs derive from domain snapshots, keeping logic inside the feature.

- **MS-02 – No feature-owned validation for HTTP payloads**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: `src/features/metric-settings/infrastructure/http/schema.zod.ts:1-200` defines all create/update/list/display schemas; controllers parse with `.parse(...)` calls (`controller.ts:23-86`). Automated validation coverage added in `__tests__/features/metric-settings/infrastructure/http/schema.zod.test.ts:1-121`.
  - Notes: Tests cover goal/timeframe requirements and display options.

## Feature: shared

### Status Summary

Shared middleware has been formalized under `src/shared/middleware`, outside the feature slices, and all routers/server-level wiring reference these modules through the shared namespace. Documentation in the stabilization checklist reflects the ownership change.

### Findings Status

- **SH-01 – Shared “feature” does not follow the canonical layout**
  - Status: **Resolved**
  - Evidence: Server wiring imports middleware from `@/shared/middleware/{rate-limiter,error}.ts` (`src/server.ts:20-24`), and routers do likewise (e.g., `src/features/analytics/infrastructure/http/router.ts:7-12`). The shared utilities now live at `src/shared/middleware/*`, separate from `src/features`.
  - Notes: Checklist/plan mark SH-01 complete, with documentation referencing the new shared module.

## Final Recommendation

- **Gold Decision:** ✅ Ready – All remediation findings show “Resolved,” acceptance criteria/tests validated (`SKIP_DB_LIFECYCLE=true npm run jest -- __tests__/features/metric-category/application/GenerateDummyCategories.test.ts` and `SKIP_DB_LIFECYCLE=true npm run jest -- __tests__/features/metric-settings/infrastructure/http/schema.zod.test.ts`, plus the broader regression suites executed during stabilization).
- **Next Steps:** Merge stabilization branch to main, monitor the next deployment for analytics/metric read-path performance (no additional code work required).
- **Sign-off:** Reviewed by Codex (2025-12-06). No outstanding findings; ready for release.
