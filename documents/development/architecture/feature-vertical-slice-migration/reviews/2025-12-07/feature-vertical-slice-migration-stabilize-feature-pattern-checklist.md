# Feature Vertical Slice Migration – Stabilize Feature Pattern Checklist

> Companion to `feature-vertical-slice-migration-stabilize-feature-pattern-plan.md`.  
> Use this checklist to track granular completion status for every task derived from the in-depth review. Cross-reference the plan for descriptions/acceptance criteria.

## How to Use
1. Keep this document in sync with the stabilization plan tasks.
2. Mark `[x]` when a sub-step is complete; add notes/dates/links as needed.
3. If scope changes, update both the plan and this checklist.
