# Vertical Slice Migration Ticket Triage
- Timestamp: 2025-12-02T14:20:00Z

## Tagging Instructions
- Use label `blocked-by-vertical-slice` (or equivalent in your tracker) for any ticket that must wait until its feature slice is ready.
- Reference the migration plan (`../plans/feature-vertical-slice-migration-plan.md`) in the ticket description so stakeholders understand the dependency.
- At grooming, confirm that owners listed in `domain-ownership-matrix.md` acknowledge the block and set a review date.

## Known Tickets/Docs to Flag
| Work Item | Location / Ticket Ref | Blocking Reason | Required Phase |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
