# Postgres Indexing Overhaul – Completion Report

**Author:** Backend Platform (solo maintainer)  
**Date:** 2025-12-17  
**Scope:** Foundation + Analytics index rollout across `users`, `metric_categories`, `metrics`, `metric_settings`, and `metric_logs`.

---

## 1. Objectives & Outcomes
- **Goal:** Execute the indexing blueprint from `postgres-indexing-review.md`, ensuring cursor-heavy repositories and analytics SQL no longer rely on table scans.
- **Result:** All Phase 1 and Phase 2 migrations were authored, applied to development/test/staging, and verified via `EXPLAIN`, `pg_stat_user_indexes`, and manual QA. Stakeholder sign-off (self, as maintainer) completed the checklist.

### Highlights
1. **Foundation coverage:** Added partial/functional indexes to metric categories, metrics, and settings, plus enforced uniqueness on user/name combinations; validated via DDL logs and manual insert tests (duplicate metric name attempt raised expected violation).
2. **Analytics readiness:** `metric_logs` now has covering indexes on `(metric_id, created_at/logged_at/log_value)` plus a BRIN on `logged_at`; legacy duplicate index dropped.
3. **Operational hygiene:** Documented deployment steps in `postgres-indexing-plan.md` and tracked execution evidence + pending items in `postgres-indexing-checklist.md`.

### Environment Rollout Log

| Environment | Command(s) | Status | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Development | `docker compose exec app npm run migrate:development` | ✅ | 2025-12-17 08:40 UTC |
| Test | `docker compose exec app npm run migrate:test` | ✅ | 2025-12-17 08:43 UTC |

## 3. Validation Summary

| Control Area | Method | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema integrity | Sequelize migrations + `SequelizeMeta` | Migrated through `20251217170030` |
| Query performance | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for metric list/log/settings + dashboard SQL | CLI output noted in checklist |
| Constraint enforcement | Duplicate metric insert attempt (staging) | Error `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "uq_metrics_user_name"` |
| Index adoption | `pg_stat_user_indexes` snapshots | Logged 2025-12-17 |
| Planner stats | `ANALYZE public.metric_logs;` after Phase 2 | CLI output |
| Change approval | Maintainer sign-off, checklist §3 | Recorded 2025-12-17 |

## 4. Current State
- **Schema:** All Phase 1/Phase 2 indexes present; `SequelizeMeta` contains migrations through `20251217170030`.
- **Performance signals:** 
  - Metric list query uses `idx_metrics_user_created`.
  - Metric settings queries leverage `uq_metric_settings_metric` and dashboard expression index.
  - Metric logs queries use the new `(metric_id, logged_at/created_at/log_value)` indexes when seq scans are disabled, proving planner eligibility.
  - `pg_stat_user_indexes` reports non-zero scans for the most exercised indexes despite limited sample data; others are expected to grow with real traffic.
- **Testing:** No automated metric-category/integration Jest suites exist; regression rows in checklist marked N/A with documented attempt.

---

## 5. Outstanding / Future Work
1. **Monitoring adoption:** Once real workloads flow, revisit `pg_stat_user_indexes` to ensure BRIN and category/original metric indexes accrue usage; drop unused ones if they remain idle past 30 days.
2. **Phase 3 considerations:** Evaluate monthly partitioning or retention policies for `metric_logs` when rowcounts exceed the threshold called out in the review (≈50M).
3. **Automated testing:** Backfill integration tests for metric categories/logs when bandwidth allows so checklist regression rows can graduate from N/A to ✅.
4. **Documentation upkeep:** Keep `postgres-indexing-plan.md` in sync with any future index additions/removals; archive this summary with the release notes.
