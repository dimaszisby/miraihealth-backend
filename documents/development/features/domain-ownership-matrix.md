| Feature           | Primary Owner             | Backup Owner           | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Metric            | Backend Team (Dimas P.)   | Backend Guild          | First to migrate after Metric Category; critical for core CRUD and analytics feeds. |
| Metric Logs       | Backend Team (Dimas P.)   | Data/Insights Partner  | Heavy writer workload; coordinate with metrics for cache invalidation. |
| Metric Category   | Backend Team (Dimas P.)   | Product Engineering    | Already in vertical slice structure; acts as reference implementation. |
| Metric Settings   | Product Engineering       | Backend Team           | Depends on Metric feature; migration blocked until Metric slice stable. |
| Analytics         | Data/Insights Partner     | Backend Team           | Ensure reporting contracts documented before moving controllers. |
| Auth              | Platform Team             | Backend Team           | Needs careful coordination with middleware/session layers. |
