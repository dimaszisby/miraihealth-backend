# Code Review Plan - 2025April16

**I. Preparation:**

1.  **Review the PRD:** Thoroughly review the Lakira Product Requirements Document (`/documents/project/plan/lakira-prd-doc.md`), paying close attention to the goals, features, UI/UX design principles, technical architecture, performance requirements, security considerations, and legal/compliance aspects.
2.  **Understand the Codebase:**
    *   Examine the project's file structure in the environment details to identify key components and modules.
    *   Review the code definitions in the feature-owned ORM files (see `src/infrastructure/db/models.ts` for bootstrap), `src/controllers`, and `src/services` to understand the data models, API endpoints, and business logic.
    *   Analyze the route definitions in `src/routes` to map API endpoints to controller functions.
    *   Since there are no specific UI components or libraries, focus on the overall structure and responsiveness of the UI components.

**II. Comparison and Discrepancy Identification:**

1.  **Functionality:**
    *   Compare the implemented features against the features described in Section 5 of the PRD (User Authentication, Dashboard, Libraries of Metric and Metric Category, Logging Metrics, Metric Settings, Public Profile, Metric Adoption).
    *   For each feature, verify that the code implements the described functionality and meets the acceptance criteria.
    *   Identify any missing features, incomplete implementations, or deviations from the PRD.
2.  **UI/UX Design:**
    *   Evaluate the UI against the design principles outlined in Section 6.1 of the PRD (Minimalist, Japanese and Javanese aesthetics).
    *   Assess whether the UI incorporates the specified elements, such as a light color palette, clean typography, and ample whitespace.
    *   Since there are no UI mockups, focus on the overall structure and responsiveness of the UI components.
    *   Check for accessibility considerations as outlined in Section 6.4 of the PRD.
3.  **Technical Architecture:**
    *   Verify that the technology stack matches the stack specified in Section 7.2 of the PRD (Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, D3.js, JWT, Sequelize).
    *   Compare the implemented API endpoints against the endpoints listed in Section 7.3 of the PRD.
    *   Ensure that the database schema aligns with the schema described in Section 7.4 of the PRD.
    *   Check if the code uses JWT-based authentication and bcrypt for password hashing as described in Sections 5.1 and 9.1.
4.  **Performance:**
    *   Analyze the code for potential performance bottlenecks.
    *   Identify areas where performance optimizations may be needed to meet the response time, scalability, and resource utilization requirements outlined in Section 8 of the PRD.
5.  **Security:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**
        *   Verify that JWT-based authentication is implemented correctly to protect API endpoints (Section 9.1).
        *   Check that bcrypt is used for password hashing with a salt factor of 10 (Section 9.1).
        *   Analyze the code for role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality (Section 9.1).
    *   **Data Security:**
        *   Identify how sensitive data is stored and transmitted.
        *   Check for encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) (Section 9.2).
        *   Analyze the code for protection against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) (Section 9.2).
            *   **SQL Injection:** Use `search_files` to look for instances where user input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   **XSS:** Use `search_files` to look for instances where user input is rendered in the UI without proper encoding or sanitization.
            *   **CSRF:** Check for the implementation of CSRF protection mechanisms, such as synchronizer tokens.
    *   **Vulnerability Management:**
        *   Assess whether the project has a vulnerability management process to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner (Section 9.3).
        *   Check if the project uses a vulnerability scanner to regularly scan the application for known vulnerabilities (Section 9.3).
        *   Determine if the project subscribes to security mailing lists and monitors security advisories to stay informed about new vulnerabilities (Section 9.3).
6.  **Legal and Compliance:**
    *   **GDPR Compliance:**
        *   Check for mechanisms to obtain user consent for data collection and processing (Section 10.1).
        *   Verify that users have the ability to access, rectify, and erase their personal data (Section 10.1).
        *   Assess whether data anonymization and pseudonymization techniques are implemented to protect user privacy (Section 10.1).
    *   **Data Privacy:**
        *   Determine if there is a comprehensive data privacy policy that outlines how user data is collected, used, and protected (Section 10.2).
        *   Check for user consent for data sharing with third parties (Section 10.2).
        *   Assess whether data retention policies are implemented to ensure that user data is not stored for longer than necessary (Section 10.2).
    *   **Terms of Service:**
        *   Determine if there are clear and concise terms of service that outline the rights and responsibilities of users and the application provider (Section 10.3).
        *   Check for user agreement to the terms of service before allowing them to use the application (Section 10.3).
        *   Assess whether the terms of service are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they are compliant with applicable laws and regulations (Section 10.3).

**III. Documentation:**

1.  **Create a Discrepancy Report:** Document each identified discrepancy in a detailed report.
2.  **Include the Following Information for Each Discrepancy:**
    *   Description of the discrepancy
    *   Location of the discrepancy in the code (file name and line number)
    *   Potential impact of the discrepancy
    *   Recommended remediation steps

**IV. Tools:**

*   `read_file`: To read the PRD and source code files.
*   `list_code_definition_names`: To understand the code structure and identify key components.
*   `search_files`: To search for specific code patterns or potential vulnerabilities.
