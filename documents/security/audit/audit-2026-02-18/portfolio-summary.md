# Security Audit Portfolio Summary - 2026-02-18

- Audience: External reviewers and portfolio evaluators
- Generated (UTC): 2026-02-18T09:05:00Z

## Executive Summary

The Lakira backend now uses a reusable security audit framework with standardized artifacts, control mappings, and CI-enforced gating rules.

This cycle completed a full framework-based audit, produced machine-readable evidence, and resolved all high-severity blockers in-cycle.

## Controls and Coverage

- Standards baseline: OWASP ASVS L2, OWASP Top 10, NIST SSDF
- Coverage domains: architecture, auth/authz, API hardening, data protection, abuse resistance, supply chain, CI/CD gates
- Automation: dependency audit + static guardrail checks + policy gate evaluation

## Findings Overview (Sanitized)

| Severity | Count | Status Summary                       |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| Critical | 0     | No open critical findings            |
| High     | 0     | No open high findings                |
| Medium   | 2     | Tracked with owners and target dates |
| Low      | 1     | Backlog-tracked with target date     |

## Remediation Posture

- High-risk blockers were remediated and gate status is now passing.
- Remaining work is dependency-focused medium/low remediation with scheduled targets.
- No temporary security exception is currently active for high/critical issues.

## Process Maturity Outcome

- Reusable templates established for every audit cycle.
- CI security gate integrated with artifact generation.
- Historical-to-current findings reconciliation completed for continuity.

## Notes on Redaction

This summary omits sensitive implementation details, exploit payloads, and secret/config values while preserving evidence of governance rigor and remediation discipline.
