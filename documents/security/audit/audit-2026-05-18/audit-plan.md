# Security Audit Plan - 2026-05-18

- Generated (UTC): 2026-02-18T11:04:09Z
- Scope: Backend code, dependencies, CI/CD, runtime hardening
- Baseline: OWASP ASVS L2, OWASP Top 10, NIST SSDF

## Objectives

1. Re-validate that previously remediated critical/high risks remain closed.
2. Detect new control drift in auth/authz, API hardening, runtime configuration, and supply chain.
3. Produce an auditable quarterly package with internal detail and sanitized portfolio output.

## In Scope

- API authentication, authorization, validation, and method/CORS behavior
- Runtime/environment controls (TLS, secrets, rate limits, dummy endpoint gating)
- Dependency and supply-chain checks (`npm audit --production`)
- CI gate configuration and artifact traceability

## Out of Scope

- Frontend-only attack surface
- Formal external compliance attestation (PCI/HIPAA/GDPR-specific)
- Live penetration testing (deferred)

## Execution Window

1. Pre-audit preparation (2026-02-18 to 2026-05-17)

- Reconcile historical findings into this run package.
- Keep checklist/control/threat artifacts synchronized with current code.

2. Quarterly execution (target date: 2026-05-18 UTC)

- Run `npm run security:delta:gate`.
- Run `npm run test:unit:security-framework`.
- Re-verify control evidence links and finding statuses.

3. Sign-off and closure (within 3 business days after execution)

- Finalize remediation statuses and exceptions.
- Publish sanitized `portfolio-summary.md`.
- Update `documents/security/audit/index.md` status/highlights.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every checklist control has status and evidence.
- Every finding (if any) maps to controls, threat scenarios, and remediation owner/SLA.
- No unresolved high/critical findings at close, unless accepted per exception policy with unexpired approval.

## Definition of Done

- Plan aligns with `audit-checklist.md`, `control-matrix.md`, and `findings-log.md`.
- Execution commands and artifact paths are explicitly documented.
