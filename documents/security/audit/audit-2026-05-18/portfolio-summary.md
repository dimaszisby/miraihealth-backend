## Executive Summary

This is a pre-audit readiness summary for the quarterly backend security review scheduled on 2026-05-18.

The team is operating with a reusable audit framework (ASVS + Top 10 + SSDF mapping), CI-integrated security gating, and reconciled historical finding records.

Current precheck outcome (2026-02-23 snapshot): no unresolved high/critical findings.

## Controls and Coverage

- Standards baseline: OWASP ASVS L2, OWASP Top 10 (2021), NIST SSDF.
- Coverage domains: architecture, auth/authz, API hardening, data/secrets, abuse resistance, supply chain, CI/CD, incident readiness.
- Automated checks in precheck snapshot:
  - Production dependency audit
  - Static security guardrail checks
  - Soft-gate policy evaluation
- Evidence quality: findings and controls are traceable to documented artifacts and repeatable command outputs.

## Findings Overview (Sanitized)

| Severity | Count | Status Summary            |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| Critical | 0     | No open critical findings |
| High     | 0     | No open high findings     |
| Medium   | 0     | No open medium findings   |
| Low      | 0     | No open low findings      |

## Remediation Posture

- Historical critical/high findings remain closed with carry-forward traceability.
- No active temporary risk exception in the current snapshot.
- Remaining planned work is quarterly evidence refresh and re-validation in the 2026-05-18 execution window.

## Notes on Redaction

This summary intentionally excludes:

- Secret values and internal credentials.
- Endpoint-sensitive exploit reproduction details.
- Infrastructure internals that materially increase attack surface disclosure.

## Definition of Done

- Summary is accurate for the stated snapshot date.
- Sensitive implementation details remain redacted while governance rigor remains visible.
