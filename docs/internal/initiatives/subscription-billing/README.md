# Subscription & Billing Kit

Add the billing skeleton that most SaaS forks need within the first month: `Plan` + `Subscription` tables, a `BillingProvider` port with a Stripe adapter, webhook signature verification, and plan-gated middleware.

**Status: Proposed — kickoff deferred.** This kit is scaffolded up front for planning visibility but implementation is blocked by the multi-tenancy foundation (Phase 4). Billing attaches to an organization, not a user.

## Scope

- `Plan` table seeded with `free` and `pro`.
- `Subscription` table (`organizationId`, `planId`, `status`, `currentPeriodEnd`, `stripeSubscriptionId`).
- `BillingProvider` port with Stripe adapter.
- `/webhooks/stripe` route with signature verification.
- `requirePlan("pro")` middleware.
- Customer portal redirect endpoint.

## Out of Scope

- Invoice/receipt generation — use Stripe's hosted invoices.
- Usage-based billing / metering.
- Multiple payment methods.
- Tax calculation (Stripe Tax or external).
- Subscription tiers beyond `free`/`pro` (add later as seeds).
