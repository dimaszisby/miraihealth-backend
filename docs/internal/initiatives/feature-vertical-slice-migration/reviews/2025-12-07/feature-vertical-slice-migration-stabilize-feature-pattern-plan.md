# Feature Vertical Slice Migration – Stabilize Feature Pattern Plan

> **Source:** `feature-vertical-slice-migration-in-depth-review.md`.  
> **Goal:** Bring every feature back to the canonical vertical-slice / DDD pattern defined in `feature-vertical-slice-migration-review-overview.md`.

## How to Read This Plan

- Each task references one or more review finding IDs (e.g., `AN-01`, `G-02`).
- Use checkboxes to track completion; keep IDs immutable even across iterations.
- Include owners/dates as metadata when known (e.g., `Owner: @user`, `Target: 2024-07-15`).
- Acceptance criteria must be testable and reference files or behaviors.

### Status Legend

| Symbol | Meaning     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `[ ]`  | Not started |
| `[~]`  | In progress |
| `[x]`  | Complete    |

## Global / Cross-Cutting Objectives

- Unify shared abstractions (CachePort, TransactionPort) where duplication exists.
- Ensure every feature exports a `feature.ts` describing its container wiring.
- Remove legacy service locators or circular dependencies between features.

### Tasks

- [x] **G-01 – Standardize read/query port pattern**
  - From findings: G-01, AN-01, M-01, M-02, ML-01
  - Description: Introduce feature-local read/query ports so application-layer queries never import `sequelize` or raw SQL directly.
  - Affected Areas: `src/features/analytics/application/queries`, `src/features/metric/application/queries`, `src/features/metric-log/application/queries`, associated `infrastructure/persistence` adapters, `infrastructure/db`.
  - Steps:
    1. Define interface(s) per feature (e.g., `VisualizationReadRepository`, `MetricReadRepository`, `MetricLogReadRepository`).
    2. Move SQL/Sequelize logic into adapters under `infrastructure/persistence` (or `infrastructure/sql`), returning domain/DTO objects expected by the application layer.
    3. Update application queries to depend on the new interfaces and inject them via feature builders.
    4. Add unit tests that stub the new ports and integration tests that cover the adapters.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - No file in `application/**` imports `sequelize`, `models`, or SQL builders directly.
    - Feature builders instantiate and provide the new read ports.
    - Tests demonstrate queries executing against stubbed ports. ✅ `__tests__/features/*/application/*.test.ts`

- [x] **G-02 – Localize DTOs and validation under each feature**
  - From findings: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, ML-02, MS-01, MS-02
  - Description: Relocate request/response DTOs, Zod schemas, and transport mappers into their owning feature slices to avoid coupling to global `types`/`utils`.
  - Affected Areas: `src/features/auth/infrastructure/http`, `src/features/metric-log/infrastructure/http`, `src/features/metric-settings/infrastructure/http`, shared DTO directories.
  - Steps:
    1. Create feature-scoped `dto.ts`/`schema.zod.ts`/`mappers.ts` files mirroring the canonical layout.
    2. Update routers/controllers to import from the new files and remove reliance on `@/types` and `@/utils` DTO exports.
    3. Provide re-export stubs if external callers still need existing DTO types (document deprecation path).
    4. Run lint/tests to ensure no unresolved imports remain.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Each affected feature has local DTO + validation modules referenced exclusively by its HTTP layer.
    - Shared `@/types/dtos` and `@/types/api` no longer contain feature-specific Zod/DTO definitions.
    - Documentation updated to reflect new ownership.

## Feature: analytics

### Goals

- Application queries depend only on domain/read ports; no direct Sequelize imports.
- Dashboard caching flows are abstracted behind a CachePort with DI through `feature.ts`.
- HTTP presentation layer pulls dependencies from a feature builder and follows canonical `infrastructure/http` naming.

### Tasks

- [x] **AN-01 – Introduce VisualizationReadRepository** (addresses finding AN-01 & G-01)

    - `getDashboardVisualization` only imports domain types + the new port.
    - Feature builder composes the port adapter.
    - Tests cover both adapter (integration) and query (unit via stub).

- [x] **AN-02 – Wrap cache access behind CachePort** (addresses finding AN-02)
  - Description: Create a feature-specific `CachePort` and Redis adapter so queries never import `vizCache` helpers directly.
  - Affected Files: `src/features/analytics/application/queries/GetDashboardVisualization.ts`, new `application/ports/CachePort.ts`, `infrastructure/cache/vizCache.ts`.
  - Steps:
    1. Define the CachePort interface covering get/set/invalidate needs.

    - Invalidation rules live close to the adapter with tests verifying key generation.

- [x] **AN-03 – Add feature builder and canonical HTTP layer** (addresses finding AN-03)
  - Description: Create `feature.ts` + `index.ts` that wire queries/ports and move controllers/routers under `infrastructure/http` naming conventions.
  - Affected Files: `src/features/analytics/infrastructure/http/**/*`, new `feature.ts`, `index.ts`, potential router exports.
  - Steps:
    1. Introduce `feature.ts` that instantiates repositories, cache, and query handlers.
    2. Move/rename `infrastructure/http` to `infrastructure/http` (or re-export) following the standard folder layout.
    3. Update controllers to resolve dependencies from the feature builder (with override hooks for testing).
    4. Update documentation + imports across the codebase.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Analytics feature exposes `buildAnalyticsFeature` and `analyticsRouter`.
    - Controllers no longer import application classes statically; they use injected feature instances.

  - Steps:
    1. Duplicate/relocate mapper logic under `auth/infrastructure/http`.

    3. If other features need the shared mapper, re-export from the new location or keep a thin wrapper referencing the auth module.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Auth controllers have no imports from `@/utils/mappers/user.mapper`.
    - DTO definitions reside inside the auth feature.

## Delivery Governance

- **Dependency Tracking:** note upstream/downstream relationships (e.g., `AUTH-02` blocked by `G-01`).
- **Testing Expectations:** list automated tests or manual verification steps when relevant.
- **Review Notes:** capture any deviations from plan or rationale for deprioritizing findings.
