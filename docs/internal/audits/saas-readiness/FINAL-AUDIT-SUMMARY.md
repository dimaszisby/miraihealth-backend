# SaaS Readiness — Final Audit Summary (Gone-Gold Closeout)

**Status:** ⚠️ **GOLD WITH CAVEATS** — the N1+N2+F1 downgrade is **lifted as of 2026-08-23**.
N1, N2, N3 and F1 all landed together (tenant-scoped cache keys per ADR-0035, production-unsafe
env refusal per ADR-0036, both now Accepted). Of the original C1–C6 caveats, **C3 is closed**
(`75cfdaa`, 2026-09-03); C1, C2, C4, C5 and C6 remain open-unchanged.
Historical context follows.
The 2026-06-05 re-audit confirmed the 05-24 baseline holds (zero source code drift between
audits) but surfaced two **NEW P0** (cache-layer cross-tenant scoping) and one **NEW HIGH**
(`DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING` has no production guard) findings that all three prior audits missed.
The repo is **not safely shippable** as a SaaS base until N1+N2+F1 land (cumulative ≤2h);
the original C1–C6 caveats remain open-unchanged.
**As of:** 2026-06-05 · **Branch:** `docs/saas-audit-2026-06-04` @ `a0301b6`
**Authoritative audit:** [`audit-2026-06-05.md`](./audit-2026-06-05.md) (delta + fresh
threat-surface re-audit, supersedes the 05-24 verdict per ADR-008 → ADR-009/010/011).
Prior authoritative audit: [`audit-2026-05-24-independent.md`](./audit-2026-05-24-independent.md).
This file is the human-readable capstone that ties the whole SaaS-readiness initiative
together; the dated audits are the evidence of record.

## 1. Executive summary

The Lakira backend began as a personal-app codebase and was hardened into a forkable SaaS
base across eight planned phases. The original baseline audit (2026-05-01) found **7 P0,
17 P1, 11 P2** gaps. Phases 0–7 closed **all 7 P0s and 15 of 17 P1s**; two post-phase
follow-ups (P1-4.2 analytics env-reads, P2-4.5 multi-origin CORS) closed the last items
blocking the strict fork-ready gate. Phase 8 (subscription/billing) is deferred by design.

An independent, skeptical "gone-gold" review on 2026-05-24 re-ran all six empirical gates
(green), pressure-tested the security- and multi-tenancy-critical claims by reading code
(they hold up), ran the architectural drift sweep, and performed a **live forkability
dry-run**. Result: the repo **passes the strict ADR-001 fork-ready gate** and has no P0
blockers, but carries six industry-standard quality gaps that an outside reviewer would fix
before recommending it as a base. Verdict: **GOLD WITH CAVEATS.**

## 2. The final audit run (2026-05-24, independent)

### Empirical gates — all six green (re-run, real exit codes)

| Gate                            | Exit | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run typecheck`             | `0`  | Clean                                                                                                                 |
| `npm run lint`                  | `0`  | Clean                                                                                                                 |
| `npm run format:check`          | `0`  | Prettier-clean                                                                                                        |
| `npm test`                      | `0`  | unit **84 suites / 497 tests**; integration **24 pass + 2 Redis-flagged skips (5 tests), 0 fail**; `migrate:test` `0` |
| `npm run security:delta:check`  | `0`  | **8 medium, 0 high/critical**                                                                                         |
| `npm run docs:openapi:generate` | `0`  | Regenerated spec byte-identical to committed (in sync)                                                                |

> ⚠️ **Re-audit integrity note:** run `npm test` exactly as the project defines it
> (`test:unit` then `test:integration`). A naïve combined `jest --selectProjects unit
integration` under `SKIP_DB_LIFECYCLE=true` _appears_ to fail (8 errors) — an artifact of
> running integration without its DB lifecycle, not a real failure. Also never let a shell
> pipeline ending in `tail`/`echo` mask jest's exit code. Gates were verified on host
> **Node 22**; CI/Docker use the mandated **Node 20** — re-confirm there.

### Strict ADR-001 fork-ready gate → **PASS**

| Criterion                            | Result                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ① Zero P0 gaps                       | ✅ (all 7 closed)                                                     |
| ② All six gates green                | ✅                                                                    |
| ③ Cat 1/4/6/7/8/11 ≥ 80% ✅          | ✅ — Cat 4 = **87.5%** after P1-4.2 + P2-4.5 closed; all others ≥ 80% |
| ④ `LICENSE` + `.env.example` present | ✅                                                                    |

> ADR-007 framed the pass as "closing P2-4.5 flips the gate." That is arithmetically
> incomplete: Cat 4 was 5✅/3⚠️ (62.5%); CORS alone → 6/8 = 75% (still < 80%). The gate only
> clears because **P1-4.2 also closed** (commit `302a335`). Both were required; both landed.

### What the audit verified solid (by reading code, not trusting prose)

- **Multi-tenant row isolation at the repository layer** — every domain read scopes by
  `organizationId` in the WHERE clause, not just middleware.
- **Refresh-token rotation** — single-use, row-locked in a transaction, with **family
  revocation on reuse** (draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics compliant).
- **Email / password-reset tokens** — 256-bit `randomBytes`, SHA-256-hashed at rest,
  single-use, time-boxed (24h / 15min).
- **JWT** — `jsonwebtoken@9.0.3` rejects `alg:none` by default; HS256 throughout.
- **Request-ID correlation** — AsyncLocalStorage propagates across awaits; injected into every
  log line.
- **Production runtime** — multi-stage Dockerfile (`npm ci --omit=dev`, non-root `USER node`,
  `dumb-init`); `deploy_production` gated on `main` + GitHub environment protection.
- **Migrations** — safe ordering (add-nullable → backfill → NOT NULL → index); no destructive
  step without a backfill path.

## 3. What was fixed (remediation journey, Phases 0–7)

**Baseline → now:** 7 P0 / 17 P1 / 11 P2 (2026-05-01) → **0 P0 / 2 P1-by-design-deferred /
P2 follow-ups** (2026-05-24).

## 4. Open caveats (the "gone-gold" punch list)

Each is scoped to ≤1 day. None blocks the ADR-001 gate or represents an exploitable P0.
**Recommended order:** C1 and C3 first (a forker / API consumer hits these first), then the
fast hardening wins C2/C5/C6, then C4.

| ID     | Caveat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Sev | Scope | Status               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----- | -------------------- |
| **C1** | **Fork flow doesn't work as printed** — `bootstrap-fork.sh` rotates `JWT_SECRET` / sets `APP_NAME` only in `.env.development` (gitignored, absent on fresh clone → silent no-op); its printed step 4 `npm test` fails out-of-box (84 suites) without `.env.test`, which is never mentioned. | P1  | ≤1d   | ☐ Open               |
| **C2** | **Lakira branding leaks into the forked runtime** — `src/config/app-name.ts:4` defaults to `"lakira-backend"`; because C1's `APP_NAME` write misses, a fresh fork brands logs/OpenAPI/queues/emails as "lakira-backend".                                                                    | P2  | ≤1h   | ☐ Open               |
| **C3** | **Error envelope inconsistent + undocumented** — `error.ts` hand-rolls 3 shapes (incl. an undocumented `"fail"` status), bypassing `errorResponse()`, violating `api-design.md`; OpenAPI documents no 4xx/5xx schema (only 429).                                                            | P1  | ≤1d   | ✅ Fixed (`75cfdaa`) |
| **C4** | **Architecture test too weak** — enforces only 3 narrow checks, no negative cases; real app→infra ORM writes, `AppError` in domain entities, and cross-feature deep imports pass green.                                                                                                     | P1  | ≤1d   | ☐ Open               |
| **C5** | **Sentry has no PII scrubbing** — `Sentry.init()` lacks a `beforeSend` to strip `authorization`/`cookie`/body secrets before egress.                                                                                                                                                        | P2  | ≤1h   | ☐ Open               |
| **C6** | **Log-redaction suffix-anchored** — `SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERN` misses `authorization`, `cookie`, `bearer`, `passwordHash` (latent: nothing logs them today).                                                                                                                                   | P2  | ≤1h   | ☐ Open               |

> **Fix-status convention:** flip ☐ Open → ✅ Fixed (with commit SHA) as each lands. When all
> six are closed, the verdict can be re-stated as **GOLD** and a new dated audit run produced
> per ADR-002.

## 5. Possible issues — needs human judgment (not blockers)

These are conscious-design or low-risk items the audit surfaced for a human decision, not
defects to fix blindly:

- **Cross-org public-metric reference** — `originalMetricExists` is intentionally org-unscoped
  (documented) and returns only a boolean, for metric cloning. Confirm "public" content
  _should_ cross tenant boundaries for your product.
- **Login lockout fails open** when Redis is down (availability over security; ASVS V2.2.1).
- **TOCTOU on single-use tokens** — `VerifyEmail` (documented, idempotent → fine) and
  `ResetPassword` (undocumented) check-then-mark non-atomically; refresh tokens use a row lock.
- **JWT `verify()` doesn't pin `algorithms` / no `iss`/`aud`** (low risk; HS256 + `jsonwebtoken@9`).
- **Unauthenticated info disclosure** — `/health` returns `NODE_ENV`; `/ready` returns
  db/redis liveness (no versions leaked).
- **Express 4 (maintenance mode)** — source of several of the 8 medium advisories; Express 5 is GA.
- **`xss-clean@0.1.4` unmaintained** (tracked P2-4.6) — retire in favor of schema-layer escaping.
- **Migration lock at scale** — `changeColumn` NOT NULL + non-`CONCURRENTLY` index lock hot
  tables for a forker migrating a populated DB.

**Key disagreements the independent run raised with the 05-20 self-audit** (full evidence in
the dated file): security findings 1→8 medium; `svix` present transitively via `resend`;
`token-generator.ts` is a second `jwt.sign` path; the "no Sequelize leak in application" and
"drift closed / arch-test enforces" claims are overstated; the runtime branding "flips in one
shot" claim is false on a fresh fork; and the error-envelope ⚠️ is stronger than graded.

---

## 7. 2026-06-05 consolidation (delta + fresh threat-surface re-audit)

The 2026-06-05 re-audit (`audit-2026-06-05.md`) ran a delta pass against everything tracked
above plus a fresh threat-surface scan. Two-pass parallel delegation to `architecture-auditor`
and `security-reviewer`. **Zero source code changes between 2026-05-24 and 2026-06-05** — the
five intervening commits are documentation/process only. The delta pass therefore largely
re-confirmed status. The fresh pass is where this re-audit earned its keep.

### Empirical gates — all six green (re-run, real exit codes)

| Gate                             | Exit | Notes                                                               |

Strict ADR-001 fork-ready gate criteria: ① zero P0 in the 05-24 baseline (still true);
② all gates green (true); ③ Cat 1/4/6/7/8/11 ≥ 80% (still true); ④ LICENSE + .env.example
(still true). The 2026-06-05 audit downgrades the **verdict** to "GOLD WITH CAVEATS —
DOWNGRADED PENDING N1+N2+F1" not because ADR-001 fails, but because the newly-surfaced
findings are exactly the kind a clean GOLD restatement should refuse to ignore.

### 2026-06-05 contradiction with prior audits — surfaced explicitly

ADR-003 says "auth slice is the canonical reference." Reading current code, `shared/auth/infrastructure/persistence/` is **flat** while `metric/` and `metric-log/` use the nested
`{models, repositories, mappers}/` layout that ADR-003's own prose mandates. The 05-24
audit acknowledged this only obliquely via C4. ADR-011 (Proposed 2026-06-05) pins the
nested layout as canonical and migrates auth. ADR-003 amended in place (Proposed →
Accepted (revised 2026-06-05)).

### New ADRs landed with this re-audit

- **ADR-009** (Proposed) — Tenant scoping is required on every cache key. Driven by N1/N2/N3.
- **ADR-010** (Proposed) — Production-unsafe env switches must be refused at schema layer. Driven by F1/F3.
- **ADR-011** (Proposed) — Resolve the canonical-DDD-layout disagreement (nested wins). Driven by §5 contradiction.

### Recommended order (revised for 2026-06-05)

1. **Same-day** — N1 + N2 + F1 (cumulative ≤2h). Verdict cannot be re-stated as clean
   GOLD until these land.
2. **Within-week** — N3 / N4 / N5 + F2 / F3 / F4 + close C5 / C6 (all ≤1d each).
3. **Within-month** — close the long-tracked C1 / C3 / C4; resolve ADR-011 (auth persistence
   migration); land N7 (OpenTelemetry) / N8 (Sequelize pool tuning) / N9 (Redis client split).
4. **Defer-and-track** — N6 (per-org queue routing); Phase 8 subscription/billing.

## 8. Recommended next actions

1. **Close N1 + N2 + F1** — same-day patch PR; lifts the verdict back to "GOLD WITH CAVEATS"
   parity with 2026-05-24.
2. **Close C1 + C3** — the two a forker / API consumer hits first (long-tracked).
3. **Land C2, C5, C6 + F2 + F3** — fast (~1h each) hardening wins.
4. **Strengthen the architecture test (C4)** with the new ADR-011 layout rule + ADR-009
   cache-key org-scoping rule so drift can't silently return.
5. **Re-run all six gates on Node 20** to confirm parity with CI/Docker.
6. When the 2026-06-05 punch list closes, produce a new dated `audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` per
   ADR-002, re-state the verdict as clean **GOLD**, and update the root
   `SAAS-BASE-CHECKLIST.md` to point at it.
7. Phase 8 (subscription/billing) remains the only deferred initiative — open its kit when
   billing is up next.
