# API reference

The OpenAPI 3.1 contract is **generated from the Zod schemas that validate live requests**, so
the document and the runtime cannot disagree about shapes.

|                    |                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spec               | [`lakira-backend-openapi.json`](./lakira-backend-openapi.json) |
| Swagger UI         | `GET /api/v1/docs`                                             |
| Raw spec over HTTP | `GET /api/v1/docs/openapi.json`                                |
| Base path          | `/api/v1`                                                      |
| Auth               | `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`                         |

Both docs endpoints require authentication unless `SWAGGER_REQUIRE_AUTH=false`.

## Do not hand-edit the spec

`lakira-backend-openapi.json` is a build artifact. A `.claude/hooks/protect-files.sh` guard
blocks writes to it, and CI fails if it drifts from what the generator produces.

Change the source instead:

| To change                              | Edit                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| a request/response shape               | `src/lib/openapi/openapi-schemas.ts` |
| which paths and operations exist       | `src/lib/openapi/openapi-docs.ts`    |
| title, servers, tags, security schemes | `src/lib/openapi/openapi-config.ts`  |

Then regenerate:

```bash
npm run docs:openapi:generate   # writes + normalises the spec
npm run docs:openapi:check      # regenerates and fails if the result differs from HEAD
```

`docs:openapi:check` runs in CI. Committing a schema change without regenerating fails the build.
Full workflow: [`../../how-to/development/regenerate-the-openapi-spec.md`](../../how-to/development/regenerate-the-openapi-spec.md).

## Coverage

**44 documented operations** across `Auth`, `Metric Categories`, `Metrics`, `Metric Logs`,
`Metric Settings`, `Trends`, and `Analytics`, plus the organization surface (invites, members,
memberships).

Two routes are served but intentionally absent from the spec, and one is documented but excluded
from fuzzing:

| Route                     | Why                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/health`      | liveness probe, not part of the API contract                                                                                                                           |
| `GET /api/v1/ready`       | readiness probe — pings Postgres and Redis                                                                                                                             |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/_ping` | documented under the `Admin` tag, which is **excluded from the contract-test tag set** — the seeded fixtures hold no admin role, so fuzzing it would only produce 403s |

## Known gaps

- Error responses are under-specified. Most operations document only success shapes and `429`;
  `4xx`/`5xx` bodies are largely absent, and the global error handler can emit shapes the spec
  does not describe. Tracked as caveat C3 in
  [`../../internal/audits/saas-readiness/`](../../internal/audits/saas-readiness/).
- Request validation is done by **Zod middleware**, not by the spec at runtime. The spec is
  generated _from_ the validators; it does not enforce anything itself. (`express-openapi-validator`
  was a declared dependency with zero imports and has been removed.)

## Contract testing

The spec is the input to two suites in `tests/contract/`: curated Postman/Newman collections and
Schemathesis property-based fuzzing. Both run in CI against a live server.
