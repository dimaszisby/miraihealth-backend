## Cadence Policy

- Full security audit every quarter.
- Delta audit required before production releases.
- Additional delta audit after security incidents or major architecture shifts.

## Maintenance Expectations

- Update framework docs when controls, standards mappings, or gate policy changes.
- Keep findings/remediation status current for active audit runs.
- Record security exceptions with expiry and approval in the run-level `decisions.md`.
- Carry unresolved medium/low findings into subsequent cycles with explicit target dates.
