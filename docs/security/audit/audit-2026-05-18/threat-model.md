## 1. System Overview

- Architecture summary: TypeScript/Express backend with feature-sliced modules, PostgreSQL/Sequelize, and Redis-backed caching/rate limiting.
- Primary assets: user identity/role data, metric/log/settings tenant data, auth tokens, environment secrets, CI security evidence.
- Internet-facing entry points: auth APIs, metrics/log/settings/category APIs, analytics APIs, docs endpoints, health endpoint.
- Trust boundaries:
  - Client -> API
  - API -> PostgreSQL
  - API -> Redis
  - CI pipeline -> repository/workflow policy
