## Context

The 2026-06-05 re-audit (`audit-2026-06-05.md` §6.2 F1) flagged that `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING` (a global killswitch for every rate limiter — global, user, analytics, switch-org, password-reset, email-verify) is parsed as a plain boolean with `.default("false")` at `src/config/zodEnv.ts:188–191`. There is **no validation that rejects `true` when `NODE_ENV=production`**. The rule is documented as "test/fuzzing only" in `.claude/rules/security.md`, but the rules-as-convention enforcement is purely advisory: a misconfigured production deploy (fat-finger, CI copying a test `.env`, a forker who didn't clean their `.env`) silently disables every rate limiter, and the only signal is a single `logger.info` line at process start (`src/shared/middleware/rate-limiter.ts:10`) that log monitoring may miss.

## Decision

Any environment variable whose `true` value would weaken a production security control MUST refuse that combination at the Zod schema layer via `.superRefine()`, causing `loadEnvOrExit()` to fail fast at process start. The minimum enforcement set for this codebase:

| Env var                  | Refused-in-production combination                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING`  | `true` when `NODE_ENV=production`                                        |
| `ALLOW_TEST_HTTP_SERVER` | `true` when `NODE_ENV=production`                                        |
| `RABBITMQ_USER`          | `"guest"` when `NODE_ENV=production` and `RABBITMQ_ENABLED`              |
| `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`      | `"guest"` when `NODE_ENV=production` and `RABBITMQ_ENABLED`              |
| `SWAGGER_REQUIRE_AUTH`   | `false` when `NODE_ENV=production` (already conventionally true; codify) |
| `SKIP_DB_LIFECYCLE`      | `true` when `NODE_ENV=production` (added 2026-08-24; twelve-factor TF-6) |

## Options considered

- _Documentation-only enforcement (status quo)._ Rejected — this audit caught a real instance; "documented as test-only" is not a safety property.
- _Runtime assertion in the consuming module (e.g., `rate-limiter.ts`)._ Considered. The schema layer is preferred because it short-circuits the boot sequence consistently with `loadEnvOrExit()`'s fail-fast contract; runtime guards run later and can be bypassed by code that bypasses the singleton.
- _Whitelist approach (every env switch must be explicitly safe-in-prod)._ Considered. Overkill at this scale; the named-bad list is more maintainable. Re-visit if the env schema doubles in size.

## Consequences

- Process refuses to start in `NODE_ENV=production` if any of the listed combinations are set. Failure surface is the startup logger error message, which is monitored.
- Test envs continue to work unchanged — only `NODE_ENV=production` triggers the refusal.
- Future security-relevant switches added to `zodEnv.ts` MUST be considered against this rule (a comment in the schema referencing this ADR will be added).
