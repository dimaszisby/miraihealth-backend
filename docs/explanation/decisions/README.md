# Architecture decision records

One decision per file, numbered globally and ordered by the date the decision was made.
Format: [Nygard ADR](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

**37 records.** 22 accepted, 15 proposed.

## Reading these

- **Status is the first thing to check.** `Proposed` means the decision was written down but is
  **not implemented** — do not assume the code matches it.
- **Records are immutable.** A decision that no longer holds is superseded by a new record, not
  edited. The `Related` line links the pair in both directions.
- **`Origin` points at the kit** the decision was made in. Those kits live under
  `docs/internal/` and are removed on fork; the record here is the durable copy, and any bare
  filenames in a record's Links section are relative to that kit.

## Where the other decisions went

Of 52 entries across 19 kit-local logs, 37 were genuine architecture decisions and are
listed below. The rest stayed in their kit because they are project-management decisions — audit
cadence, phase ordering, which sweep to run first — and mean nothing outside the initiative that
made them. Security audit runs keep their own `ADR-SEC-*` series, scoped to the run.

## Adding one

Take the next free number, copy the shape of an existing record, and open with `Status: Proposed`.
Flip to `Accepted` in the same PR that implements it — a registry full of stale `Proposed` entries
is worse than no registry, because readers cannot tell intent from fact.
