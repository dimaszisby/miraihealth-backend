- **Note:** originally logged as _Implemented_.

## Context

Audit gap [P0-5.1] requires per-request log correlation. Two common options: a third-party library like `cls-rtracer` that wraps `cls-hooked`, or Node's native `AsyncLocalStorage` (stable since Node 16). The repo runs on Node 20.

## Decision

Use the built-in `AsyncLocalStorage` from `node:async_hooks`. Export a singleton store from `src/shared/middleware/request-id.ts` and have the request-ID middleware run the rest of the chain inside `store.run(reqId, () => next())`.

## Options considered

- _`cls-rtracer`._ Adds a runtime dependency and a maintenance burden for a feature Node now exposes natively. Rejected.
- _Echo `req.id` into a logger child instance per-request._ Rejected: requires every log call site to use the child logger. Misses any indirect logger usage (e.g., from a use case called by a controller).
- _Just set a header and a `req.id` property without an async store._ Rejected: code paths several `await`s deep cannot read `req.id` without threading it through every function signature.

## Consequences

- Zero new runtime deps.
- Anywhere in the call tree that needs the current request ID (logger format, Sentry tags, future tracer): `requestIdStorage.getStore()`.
- The worker process (`src/worker.ts`) gets the same primitive but with a per-message store rather than per-request. Track that as a follow-up; do not block this kit.
