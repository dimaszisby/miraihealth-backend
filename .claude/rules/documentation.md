# Documentation Conventions

`docs/` is organised by **what the reader is doing**, not by what the artifact is called.
Four Diátaxis quadrants ship with the template; `internal/` holds this project's working material
and is deleted on fork.

<!-- PLACEMENT-TABLE:START — must stay byte-identical to .claude/agents/doc-writer.md -->

## Where a document goes

Ask what the reader is doing, then place it. Never place by artifact name.

| The document…                                        | Goes to                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| teaches a newcomer a skill, followed start to finish | `docs/tutorials/`                                |
| gets an experienced reader through one task          | `docs/how-to/<area>/`                            |
| is looked up, not read through                       | `docs/reference/`                                |
| explains a concept, a trade-off, or why something is | `docs/explanation/`                              |
| records an architectural decision                    | `docs/explanation/decisions/adr-NNNN-<slug>.md`  |
| tracks a piece of work — plan, checklist, tracker    | `docs/internal/initiatives/<topic>/`             |
| is a dated one-off note or session TODO              | `docs/internal/todos/`, `docs/internal/dev-log/` |
| is an audit run                                      | `docs/internal/audits/<program>/`                |
| is a postmortem                                      | `docs/internal/incidents/`                       |

Two rules keep the tree honest:

1. **One quadrant per document.** If it both teaches and specifies, split it.
2. **Generated files are never hand-edited.** `docs/reference/api/lakira-backend-openapi.json`
   comes from Zod schemas and is drift-gated in CI — edit `src/lib/openapi/**` instead. It is also
   **validity-gated**: `docs:openapi:validate` resolves every `$ref` and checks operation ids and
   responses. Drift-gating alone was not enough — a spec that is self-consistently wrong passes a
   diff, and one did, breaking a downstream repo's type generation.

If a document does not obviously fit, it is usually working material: put it under
`docs/internal/` rather than inventing a new top-level folder.

## Working material still uses doc kits

Anything under `docs/internal/initiatives/<topic>/` follows the kit pattern. Size it to the work:

| Scope                                             | Kit          | Contents                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large initiative (multi-week, affects CI/process) | Full kit     | README + plan + checklist + ticket + decisions + incidents + metrics-tracker |
| Medium effort (2–5 working days)                  | Standard kit | README + plan/ticket (merged) + checklist + decisions                        |
| Small infra change / quick sweep                  | Lean kit     | README + checklist + at least one `decisions.md` entry                       |
| Single-commit fix                                 | Micro entry  | One entry in the nearest `decisions.md` referencing the commit SHA           |

Ephemeral work skips the kit entirely: one file at
`docs/internal/todos/YYYY-MM-DD-todo-<kebab-title>.md`, tracked in git but user-controlled and
deletable without a follow-up PR. Promote it to a kit if it grows into an initiative.

## Architectural decisions

A kit's `decisions.md` is a **working log**. A decision that constrains how the system is
built — and would still matter to someone who never saw the initiative — is promoted to
`docs/explanation/decisions/` as its own numbered record, with a pointer left behind.

Decisions that only coordinate the work (phase order, audit cadence, which sweep to run first)
stay in the kit. See `docs/explanation/decisions/README.md` for the format and the next free
number.

For migrations: log an entry for every schema change, referencing the migration filename.

## Before writing anything

1. Does a document already cover this? Update it. Never create a second copy — duplicated
   content drifts, and the drift is silent. (`.claude/rules/commands.md` documented a
   `migrate:dev` script that never existed, for exactly this reason.)
2. Check the placement table above before choosing a folder.
3. If you add a top-level folder under `docs/`, update `docs/README.md` in the same change.
