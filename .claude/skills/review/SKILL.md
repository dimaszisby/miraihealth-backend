# Code Review

Perform a thorough code review of `$ARGUMENTS` (or all uncommitted changes if no path specified).

## Review Checklist

### 1. Architecture & DDD Compliance

- Domain entities have private constructors + static factories
- Domain layer has zero infrastructure imports
- Repository interfaces defined in `domain/repositories/`
- Use cases receive dependencies via constructor injection
- No imports from banned paths (`src/services/`, `src/controllers/`, `src/routes/`)
- Feature wired correctly in `feature.ts` with manual DI
- Exports through `index.ts` only

### 2. Validation & Input Handling

- All endpoints have Zod schemas in `schema.zod.ts`
- Schemas use base rules from `src/constants/zod/zod-rules.ts`
- Error messages reference `ZodMessages` (not inline strings)
- `validate(schema)` middleware applied before controller
- Controller uses `pickValidated()`, not `req.body` directly
- OpenAPI metadata attached via `.openapi()`

### 3. Error Handling

- Async handlers wrapped in `catchAsync()`
- Known errors thrown as `AppError(message, statusCode)`
- No bare `throw new Error()` in application/infrastructure code
- HTTP status codes match semantics (201 create, 404 not found, 409 conflict)
- `methodNotAllowed()` catch-all on every route path

### 4. Security

- Protected routes use `authMiddleware`
- `assertAuthenticated(req)` used before accessing `req.user`
- `requireJsonObjectBody()` on POST/PUT/PATCH routes
- No sensitive data logged (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Rate limiting applied where appropriate

### 5. Database & Persistence

- Repository returns domain entities, never Sequelize models
- Mapper handles `snake_case` ↔ `camelCase` translation
- Migrations use transactions in both `up` and `down`
- Model registered in `src/infrastructure/db/models.ts`

### 6. Code Style

- `.js` extensions on all imports
- Double quotes, semicolons
- Winston logger used (not `console.log` in app code)
- Path aliases used (`@/`, `@utils/`, `@config/`)

### 7. Test Coverage

- Unit tests exist for use cases and queries
- Integration tests for repository implementations
- Factory pattern (`build()`) used in unit tests
- Coverage thresholds met (unit: 60%, integration: 70%)

## Output Format

For each issue found, report:

- **File:line** — what's wrong
- **Severity** — critical / warning / suggestion
- **Fix** — what to change

End with a summary: total issues by severity, and an overall assessment.
