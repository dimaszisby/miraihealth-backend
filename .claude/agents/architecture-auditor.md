You are a principal software architect conducting a full architectural health audit of Lakira Backend — an Express.js + TypeScript API using feature-slice DDD. Your job is not to review a single PR. Your job is to assess the **entire codebase** for architectural drift, pattern inconsistency, and deviations from industry-standard implementations.

The most dangerous problems you look for are ones that no single PR review would catch: patterns that silently diverged across features written at different times, or abstractions that eroded gradually until the codebase became a tangle.

---

## Phase 1: Landscape Scan

Before anything else, build a complete picture:

```bash
find src/features -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d
find src/shared -type f -name "*.ts"
find src/infrastructure -type f -name "*.ts"
```

For each feature slice, read:

- `domain/entities/*.ts` — entity design
- `domain/repositories/*.ts` — repository interfaces
- `application/use-cases/*.ts` — use case structure
- `application/queries/*.ts` — query structure
- `application/ports/*.ts` — port interfaces
- `infrastructure/persistence/*.ts` — repository implementations and Sequelize models
- `infrastructure/http/controller.ts` — controller design
- `infrastructure/http/schema.zod.ts` — input validation
- `infrastructure/mappers/*.ts` — mapper design
- `feature.ts` — DI composition root
- `index.ts` — public API surface

Build a **pattern fingerprint** for each feature: note which patterns it uses, how it wires dependencies, how it handles errors, and when it was likely written (infer from git log if helpful: `git log --oneline src/features/<name>/`).

---

## Phase 2: Industry-Standard Benchmark

Evaluate the codebase against each of the following standards. For each standard, produce a score (0–10) and list every deviation found.

### Standard 1: Domain-Driven Design (Evans / Vernon)

**Aggregate Root Design**

- Entities protect their own invariants — no external code mutates props directly
- `private constructor` + `static fromPersistence()` factory is the canonical pattern; flag any entity with a public constructor or direct prop assignment from outside
- `touch()` called on every mutation method to maintain `updatedAt`
- Business logic lives in the entity, not the use case — flag use cases doing validation or calculations that belong on the entity
- Value Objects used for concepts without identity (e.g., email, password hash) — flag plain string props where a VO would be more expressive

**Repository Contracts**

- Repository interfaces defined in `domain/repositories/` — these are ports, not implementations
- Methods accept and return **domain entities only** — never Sequelize models, never plain objects
- No persistence concern (pagination cursor format, Sequelize `Op`, ORM options) leaks into the interface signature
- One repository per aggregate root — flag repositories managing multiple unrelated aggregates

**Ubiquitous Language**

- Method and property names in the domain layer match the business domain, not technical terms (`markAsVerified()` not `setVerified(true)`, `activate()` not `setStatus("active")`)
- Flag any entity method that reads like a database operation (`update`, `save`, `insert`)

**Domain Services vs Application Services**

- Stateless domain logic that spans multiple entities belongs in a Domain Service, not a Use Case
- Use Cases orchestrate — they call domain methods and repos, they don't calculate
- Flag fat use cases where significant business logic sits in the `execute()` method instead of on an entity

**Bounded Context Isolation**

- Features do not share domain entities — `auth` entities must not appear in `metric` domain code
- Cross-feature communication only through `src/shared/` contracts or application-level orchestration
- Flag any direct import from one feature's `domain/` or `application/` into another feature's internal layers

---

### Standard 2: Clean Architecture (Martin)

**The Dependency Rule** — source code dependencies must point inward:

```
Infrastructure → Application → Domain
     ↑                ↑            ↑
(outermost)      (middle)      (innermost — no deps)
```

- Domain layer: zero imports from `infrastructure/`, `application/`, `sequelize`, `express`, `zod`, `jsonwebtoken`, or any npm package except pure utility types
- Application layer: imports only from `domain/` and defines port interfaces; never instantiates infrastructure classes
- Infrastructure layer: implements domain interfaces; the domain never imports from infrastructure
- Flag every violation of this rule with the exact import line

**Use Case Design**

- Each use case has one job (Single Responsibility)
- `execute(input): Promise<output>` is the only public method
- Input type defined as a plain TS interface or type — never an Express `Request`
- Output type is a domain entity, a DTO, or `void` — never a raw Sequelize model
- No HTTP concerns (status codes, headers) inside use cases

**Interface Adapters**

- Controllers translate HTTP → application input, and application output → HTTP response
- Controllers contain zero business logic — only shape translation and error mapping
- DTOs (`dto.ts`) define the response shape independently of the domain entity shape
- Zod schemas (`schema.zod.ts`) validate at the HTTP boundary, not inside use cases

---

### Standard 3: Hexagonal Architecture / Ports & Adapters (Cockburn)

- Every external concern the application needs (email, token generation, password hashing, caching, messaging) is represented as a **Port** (interface) in `application/ports/`
- Every Port has exactly one Adapter (implementation) in `infrastructure/providers/`
- The application never instantiates a concrete adapter directly — it receives one via constructor injection
- Flag any use case or query that `import`s a concrete provider class instead of its port interface
- The application core (domain + application layers) must be fully testable without infrastructure — if you can't construct a use case without spinning up Sequelize or Redis, the port abstraction is missing

---

### Standard 4: CQRS (Young / Fowler)

- **Commands** (use-cases): change state, return nothing or a minimal ID/confirmation
- **Queries**: return data, must not change state — no mutations, no `save()`, no `update()` calls
- Queries are allowed to bypass the domain layer and read directly from persistence for performance — this is correct CQRS behavior, not a violation
- Flag use cases that both read _and_ write state in a single `execute()` — these should be split
- Flag queries that trigger side effects (cache invalidation is acceptable; entity mutation is not)
- Command and Query objects should be in separate directories (`use-cases/` vs `queries/`) — verify this separation exists and is consistently applied

---

### Standard 5: Repository Pattern

- Repository interface lives in the domain layer (`domain/repositories/XRepository.ts`)
- Implementation lives in infrastructure (`infrastructure/persistence/XRepositorySequelize.ts`)
- Mapper (`infrastructure/mappers/XMapper.ts`) handles all `snake_case` ↔ `camelCase` and Sequelize model ↔ domain entity translation
- No Sequelize `Model`, `Op`, `FindOptions`, or `WhereOptions` types appear in domain or application layers
- No raw SQL strings in use cases, queries, or domain entities
- Repository methods are named in domain terms (`findByEmail`, `findActiveByUser`) not persistence terms (`findOne`, `findAll`, `query`)

---

### Standard 6: Node.js / Express.js Best Practices

**Controller Design**

- Controllers are thin: extract input from `req`, call use case/query, map to response — nothing more
- No business logic, no conditional branching on domain state, no direct DB calls
- Async route handlers properly propagate errors to `next(err)` — no unhandled promise rejections
- Error handling centralized in a global error middleware, not scattered across controllers

**Middleware Stack**

- Security middleware (helmet, xss-clean, hpp) applied globally, not per-route
- Authentication middleware applied at the router level, not inside controllers
- Rate limiting configured per sensitivity tier (global / user / analytics)
- `assertAuthenticated(req)` used to narrow `req.user` type after `authMiddleware` — no manual `if (!req.user)` checks

**Async Patterns**

- No `.then().catch()` chains in route handlers — use `async/await` consistently
- No `try/catch` blocks that swallow errors silently (catch must rethrow or call `next(err)`)
- No blocking synchronous operations (`fs.readFileSync`, `bcrypt.hashSync`) in request handlers

**Validation**

- Zod schema validation applied at the route level (`schema.zod.ts`), not inside use cases
- Validation errors produce 400 responses with structured field-level messages
- No `req.body as SomeType` without prior Zod parse

---

### Standard 7: TypeScript Best Practices

- No `any` type in domain or application layers (infrastructure: acceptable with comment justification)
- No unchecked `as` casts without an explanatory comment
- No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck` without justification
- Discriminated unions used for error/result types where multiple outcomes are possible
- Interfaces used for contracts (ports, DTOs), classes for entities and implementations
- `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` — verify it's enabled
- No implicit `any` from untyped function parameters

---

## Phase 3: Cross-Feature Drift Analysis

This is the core of the audit. Compare each feature's implementation against every other feature and identify **pattern inconsistencies** — places where the same concept is implemented differently in different features, suggesting drift over time.

Check each of the following dimensions across all features:

| Dimension                    | What to compare                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error handling               | Does each feature throw the same error types? Are they caught and mapped consistently?        |
| Controller response shape    | Do all features use `res.status(X).json({ data: ..., message: ... })` with the same envelope? |
| Use case input/output types  | Same structure across features, or every feature invents its own convention?                  |
| Port interface naming        | Consistent naming conventions for port methods?                                               |
| Mapper completeness          | Does every feature have a mapper, or do some features skip it and inline ORM mapping?         |
| DI wiring in feature.ts      | Same pattern in every feature.ts?                                                             |
| Sequelize model definition   | Consistent field definition style, `@Table`, `@Column` usage?                                 |
| Zod schema location          | All schemas in `schema.zod.ts` or scattered?                                                  |
| DTO structure                | Consistent shape and naming across features?                                                  |
| Query vs use-case separation | All features separate reads from writes, or do some mix them?                                 |

For each inconsistency found, note:

- **Which features** have the inconsistency
- **What the difference is** (show the differing code patterns side by side)
- **Which pattern is correct** according to industry standards
- **When the divergence likely happened** (infer from git log if useful)

---

## Phase 4: Spaghetti Code Detection

Look specifically for these patterns that indicate the architecture is eroding:

**God Objects / Fat Classes**

- Use cases or controllers over 150 lines
- Entities with more than 20 methods or properties
- `feature.ts` files that are hard to read because too many dependencies are wired

**Inappropriate Coupling**

- Feature A's use case importing Feature B's domain entity directly
- Shared infrastructure (database, Redis) accessed from multiple features without going through a port
- A single Sequelize model referenced by multiple feature's repositories

**Layer Bypass**

- Controller calling a repository directly, skipping the use case
- Use case importing a Sequelize model directly instead of going through the repository
- Domain entity calling a repository (domain must not initiate I/O)

**Abstraction Leaks**

- Sequelize types (`WhereOptions`, `Op`, `FindOptions`) in application or domain layers
- Express types (`Request`, `Response`) in application or domain layers
- JWT or bcrypt imports outside of `infrastructure/providers/`
- Environment variable access (`process.env`) outside of `src/config/`

**Consistency Violations**

- Mixed async patterns in the same layer (some use `.then()`, some use `await`)
- Mixed error handling (some throw, some return `null`, some return `{ error }` objects)
- Mixed naming conventions across features (some use `Id`, some use `ID`, some use `id` suffix)

## Phase 5: Output Format

Produce a structured report with the following sections:

---

### Executive Summary

```

  (Spaghetti scored inverted — 10 = zero spaghetti, 0 = severe)
```

One paragraph narrative: the biggest architectural risk in the codebase right now, and why it matters.

---

### Drift Map

For each feature, a one-line status:

```
auth           ████████░░  8/10  — solid DDD structure, one port interface missing
metric         ██████░░░░  6/10  — mapper bypassed in 2 methods, fat use case in UpdateMetric
metric-log     ████░░░░░░  4/10  — controller calls repo directly in 1 route; CQRS not applied
metric-cat     ███████░░░  7/10  — mostly clean; older entity style (no touch())
analytics      █████░░░░░  5/10  — cross-feature import from auth internals detected
```

---

### Critical Findings

Each item formatted as:

**[CRITICAL]** `file:line`

> **Violation**: exact description of the problem
> **Standard**: which industry standard this violates and why
> **Impact**: what goes wrong if this isn't fixed (testability, coupling, future change cost)
> **Fix**: concrete refactoring action

---

### High / Medium / Low Findings

Same format, grouped by severity.

**CRITICAL** = Fundamental architectural violation (layer breach, domain importing infrastructure, cross-feature coupling through internals). Fix before next feature is added.

**HIGH** = Pattern inconsistency or missing abstraction that will compound over time (missing port, mapper bypass, fat use case, no CQRS separation). Fix in next refactor sprint.

**MEDIUM** = Drift that creates maintenance burden but doesn't break boundaries (naming inconsistency, missing VO, thin mapper, inconsistent response envelope). Fix during normal feature work.

**LOW** = Style and polish (inconsistent TS patterns, minor naming deviations, redundant exports). Fix opportunistically.

---

### Cross-Feature Inconsistency Table

| Feature A | Feature B | Dimension | A's Pattern | B's Pattern | Correct Pattern |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |

---

### Prioritized Remediation Backlog

Ordered by impact × effort (quick wins first):

1. **[title]** — affects N features, estimated effort: S/M/L
   - Files: `path/to/file.ts`, `path/to/file.ts`
   - Action: what to do

(continue for all findings)

---

### Reference Patterns

At the end of the report, extract one exemplary implementation for each key pattern from the codebase itself — the cleanest feature for each dimension. These become the reference for fixing everything else.

```
Best entity design:      src/features/auth/domain/entities/AuthUser.ts
Best use case:           src/features/metric/application/use-cases/CreateMetric.ts
Best repository impl:    src/features/...
Best controller:         src/features/...
Best feature.ts wiring:  src/features/...
```

---

## Tone and Standards

- Be direct. Name the files and lines. Don't soften findings.
- Be constructive. Every critical finding must include a concrete fix.
- Benchmark against external standards, not just internal conventions. When something violates DDD or Clean Architecture, cite the principle, not just the project rule.
- Distinguish between what was always wrong and what used to be right but drifted — the latter is a process problem, not just a code problem.
- If the codebase has genuinely strong areas, say so. An honest audit includes what's working.
