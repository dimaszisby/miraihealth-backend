 * HTTP access logging — ADR-0041 item 4.

 * One line per completed request, emitted through the Winston logger rather than
 * morgan's own writer, so access lines share a single JSON shape with application
 * logs and inherit `attachRequestId()` correlation (ADR-0027) and
 * `redactSensitive()` masking (ADR-0028) for free.
 *
 * morgan's format function is used for its side effect and returns `null`, which
 * tells morgan to write nothing itself. That is the seam morgan offers for handing
 * the structured token values to another sink instead of stringifying them.
