# Dependency Management Recommendations

Based on the code review, here are some recommendations for dependency management:

1.  **Run `npm audit`:** Run the `npm audit` command to identify and address any known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
2.  **Update Dependencies:** Regularly update dependencies to ensure that you are using the latest versions with security patches.
3.  **Dependency Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (semver) to specify dependency versions. This allows you to control which versions of dependencies are installed and to avoid breaking changes.
4.  **Remove Unused Dependencies:** Remove any unused dependencies to reduce the project's bundle size and improve performance.
