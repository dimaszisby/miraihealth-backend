# Security Recommendations

Based on the code review, here are some security recommendations:

1.  **JWT Secret Security:** Ensure that the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is stored securely and is not exposed in the codebase or configuration files. Consider using a more robust secret management solution.
2.  **Input Validation:** While Zod is being used for input validation, ensure that all routes that accept user input are properly validated. Pay close attention to routes that handle sensitive data, such as authentication credentials and user profile information.
3.  **Password Handling:** The code uses `bcrypt` to hash passwords, which is a good practice. However, ensure that the salt is generated securely and that the hashing algorithm is configured with a sufficient number of rounds to prevent brute-force attacks.
4.  **Validate Middleware:**
    *   Consider making the `schema` parameter in the `validate` middleware required to prevent accidental omission of validation.
    *   Implement more robust error handling in the `handleError` function, such as logging errors to a dedicated logging service or providing more informative error messages to the client.
    *   Consider making the middleware more flexible by allowing it to handle schemas with different structures.
5.  **Dependency Management:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address any known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. Regularly update dependencies to ensure that you are using the latest versions with security patches.
